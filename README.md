# Project Proposal:
Our planned project is a time-sheet payment calculator for employees. It will allow users to calculate their wages for a given pay period. An admin/employer can set wages for 
employees/positions, then employees can input their hours.

possible feature notes:
* have an admin (think HR) who assigns hours/pay to employees
* or assign hourly wage to employees by their id
* employees can login and input their hours, calculate pay automatically
* calculate hours worked by having user enter the times they clocked in/out
* payment calculator, more or less (timesheets)
* can add on things like taxes and such once basic is made
* differentiate students by csuc id
* department id, position #, job code, etc. can be stored as well
* should be fairly simple to do basic implementation, bare viable product, then add on - reasonably complex but not insane
* eg. could make fancy table ui, auto-generate tables from data, auto-email completed table, etc.
* could be helpful to campus
* use google oauth credentials to handle signin? use a plugin?
* need to figure out backend stuff - what info do we need to store, how should things be organized? table relations?

Future Scope:
* Reports and dashboard for admin/employee's
* Email notifications for payroll run, missing timesheets.
